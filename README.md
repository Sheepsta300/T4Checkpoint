I'm still learning how to use github as I've never used it before and was having trouble committing changes to the forked repository taken from canvas. 
Instead I made a new repository and uploaded files here, but I'm not sure what the package name would be for this repository and have therefore
left it blank. I was running these files on eclipse and had a different package name so they made need a package name to be included to run
I'm not entirely sure, sorry for the inconvenience but again I've never used GitHub before, and theres no information about it on canvas.
